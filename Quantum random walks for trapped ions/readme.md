Most experimental implementations of quantum random walks use physical "walkers" that can be in superposition. From a computational perspective, that's silly: using a quantum computer, one can encode the position of a walker in Log(N) qubits, and have full flexibility to use any possible coin or graph. I experimented with how this could be compiled efficiently for specific types of hardware, and how intersting experiments (like measuring topological winding numbers) could be performed on NISQ devices.
