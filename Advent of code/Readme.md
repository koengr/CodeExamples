Advent of Code offers some very interesting programming challenges throughout December of each year: adventofcode.com

I often pick some of the more challenging exercises (as in: the ones completed by the smallest fraction of accounts, as displayed by the Stats page), for example: 2021 Day 18 and 2022 Day 25.
