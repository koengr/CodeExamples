This is mostly a weekend project to challenge myself to write a Crawler, using BeautifulSoup to parse HTML-pages and Pandas to process large amounts of data. 

I picked TicketSwap.com as my target website, which is a platform for selling second-hand tickets for festivals and concerts. Current functionality allows automatically scraping a list of events stored in a database, thereby growing a local database of historic ticket prices. Ultimate goal would be to publicly show a history of all ticket prizes, and predict when events sell out (let me know if you'd like to contribute!).
