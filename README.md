# Code Examples

This repository collects some examples of programming I've done over the years. 

NB: Most of the code was intended for private use and for quick scientific checks -- it may not be as extensively structured or documented as I would ideally do, owing to a time trade-off. Some parts are incomplete and/or belong to bigger projects. Please don't consider this directly usable code for your own project!

(Wolfram files (.nb, .wl, .m) are best read using Mathematica or Wolfram Player. )

Also see my non-programming products, such as:
- Some of my writings, such as http://GuideToQuantum.com/
- Public talks and lectures: http://www.koengroenland.com/about-me
