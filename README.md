# Code Examples

This repo collects some examples of programming I've done over the years. NB: most of the code was purely for private use, hence it's badly documented, contains 'scratchpad' commands, and it not always fully out. Nevertheless, I hope it gives a fair glance at some deeper topics I delved into.
